This Haskell code attempts to perform an unsafe operation without proper error handling, which can lead to runtime exceptions. The `head` function is used on an empty list, leading to a `Prelude.head: empty list` exception.  Additionally, the pattern matching in the `case` statement is not exhaustive, potentially resulting in unexpected behaviour.

```haskell
import Data.List

processList :: [Int] -> Int
processList xs = case xs of
  (x:_) -> head xs + 1
  [] -> 0

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = processList []
  print result
```
