The solution handles the possibility of an empty list gracefully, preventing runtime errors:

```haskell
import Data.Maybe

processList :: [Int] -> Maybe Int
processList xs = case xs of
  (x:_) -> Just (x + 1) 
  [] -> Nothing

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result1 = processList [1,2,3]
  let result2 = processList []
  print (maybe 0 id result1)
  print (maybe 0 id result2)

--Alternative solution using safe functions
processList' :: [Int] -> Maybe Int
processList' xs = fmap (+1) (listToMaybe xs)

main' :: IO ()
main' = do
  let result1 = processList' [1,2,3]
  let result2 = processList' []
  print (maybe 0 id result1)
  print (maybe 0 id result2)
```

This revised version utilizes the `Maybe` type to represent the possibility of a successful result or nothing. The `maybe` function is then used to handle both cases gracefully.
